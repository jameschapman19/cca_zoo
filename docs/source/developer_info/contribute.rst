and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cca-zoo has documentation at cca-zoo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ but feedback/corrections
on areas that are unclear or incorrect would be really helpful. Also any example notebooks can be added in the
tutorial notebooks folder.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
