## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, revealing hidden relationships across multiview datasets is critical. **CCA-Zoo** is your go-to library, featuring a robust selection of linear, kernel, and deep canonical correlation analysis methods.

Designed to be user-friendly, CCA-Zoo is inspired by the ease of use in `scikit-learn` and `mvlearn`. It provides a seamless programming experience with familiar `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Whether you're a `pip` enthusiast or a `poetry` aficionado, installing CCA-Zoo is a breeze:

```bash
pip install cca-zoo
# For additional features
pip install cca-zoo[probabilistic]
```

For Poetry users:

```bash
poetry add cca-zoo
# For extra features
poetry add cca-zoo[probabilistic]
```

## üèéÔ∏è Performance Highlights
CCA-Zoo shines when it comes to high-dimensional data analysis. It significantly outperforms scikit-learn, particularly as dimensionality increases. For comprehensive benchmarks, see our [script](benchmark/cca_high_dimensions.py) and the graph below.
